# [Systemd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd)

**systemd** is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a _system_ and _service manager_ that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system.

`systemd` provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
